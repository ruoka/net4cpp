# Echo Server Example

```cpp
try
{
    auto ator = acceptor{"::1", "2112"}; // IPv6 localhost
    auto [stream,client,port] = ator.accept();

    while(stream)
    {
        auto echo = ""s;
        getline(stream, echo);
        stream << echo << endl;
        clog << echo << endl;
    }
}
catch(const exception& e)
{
    cerr << "Exception: " << e.what() << endl;
}
```

# Http Request Example

```cpp
try
{
    auto s = connect("http://www.google.com");

    s << "GET / HTTP/1.1"                << crlf
      << "Host: www.google.com"          << crlf
      << "Connection: close"             << crlf
      << "Accept: text/plain, text/html" << crlf
      << "Accept-Charset: utf-8"         << crlf
      << crlf
      << flush;

    while(s)
    {
        auto c = ' ';
        s >> noskipws >> c;
        clog << c;
    }
    clog << flush;
}
catch(const exception& e)
{
    cerr << "Exception: " << e.what() << endl;
}
